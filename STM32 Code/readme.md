## STM32 Code
This repository contains files for a project developed for the UCT STM32F0 development board. The project utilizes STM32CubeMX files which have been edited specifically for this project. The main.c file contains code to control LEDs based on wall detection for the front, left, and right sides.

## Contents
- **STM32CubeMX Files:** This folder contains the STM32CubeMX project files edited for this project.
- **main.c:** This file contains the code to control LEDs based on wall detection.
- **Other Files:** Any other relevant files can be listed here.

## Project Setup
To set up the project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the STM32CubeMX project files using STM32CubeMX software.
3. Configure the project settings and generate the code.
4. Import the generated code into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
5. Compile and flash the code onto the UCT STM32F0 development board.

## Usage
Once the code is flashed onto the UCT STM32F0 development board:
- The LED for the front side will turn on if a wall is detected in front of the board.
- The LED for the left side will turn on if a wall is detected to the left of the board.
- The LED for the right side will turn on if a wall is detected to the right of the board.
